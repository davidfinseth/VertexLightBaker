# VertexLightBaker
A tool for Autodesk Maya that bakes lighting into the vertex color data of an object. This tool requires that you have Arnold installed as it makes use of it to do the rendering.

## Installation
Download or clone the most recent version of your project into the directory of your choice. Open maya and drag the file ```drag_into_maya.py``` into your maya scene. This will prompt you to navigate to the root folder of the VertexLightBaker project you just downloaded. After that, just close and reopen maya. A new “Tools” shelf will be added with the Vertex Light Baker installed on it.
